# EmailSender
For Aeroconsult 2019 I needed to send each of the participants who bothered to sign up an email which contains their code to be used for check-in, attendence & interactions with the companies.

It simply consists of a python program and a csv list which contains the codes and email address on each line. 

It worked perfectly except you can't send more than around 80-85 emails before Google blocks you and have to wait a few minutes.
